- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

This assignment was very straightforward for me, as I felt like Encapsulation was a familiar concept. I find it very intuitive to connect classes to each other to implement a project. Javadoc comments were a little bit difficult for me to figure out, but I figured out they were pretty easy eventuallyâ€“I would give the advice to not be afraid of javadoc comments!
